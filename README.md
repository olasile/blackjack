**BlackJack**

This game uses a standard 52-card deck and consists of one player and a dealer.
A game begins with the dealer and player receiving two cards from a shuffled deck. The player
will then decide to "hit" or "stay" without "busting" or until "BlackJack" (definitions below). Once
the player's turn is over, the dealer will "hit" until the game ends.
The player's objective is to score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21 points. Cards
have the following values:

● Ace: 1 or 11
● 2-10: face value (e.g. 2 = 2, 5 = 5)
● Jack, Queen, King: 10
● Card suit (spades, hearts, etc.) does not change these values

The game has four concepts:
● BlackJack: A player or dealer scores 21 points; they win, and the game is over.
● Bust: A player or dealer scores over 21 points; they lose, and the game is over.
● Hit: When a player or dealer asks for another card.
● Stay: When a player decides to end their turn.

Special notes:
A dealer must "hit" if their score is below 17 Ace is worth two values, 1 and 11.
